## Description

Jelly Byte is a social platform for sharing Spotify songs. You can create shareable playlists and link songs from Spotify. In the future, the goal was to let users play "random" songs from the friends that they follow. Spotify currently only lets them play specific songs &ndash; not use them as a "radio station" or aggregate multiple friends together. People like to discover the music that their friends listen to and Jelly Byte intends to make that happen.
